  - read-in of complete file is not necessary anymore for ID3v2-tag-parsing
  - implementation of frame-parsers for APIC, GEOB, UFID, USLT, ETCO, COMM, MCDI, PRIV, PCNT and POPM
    as well as text- and URL-frames

  - added 7 frame-types (APIC, GEOB, UFID, USLT, ETCO, COMM and MCDI)

* Wed Sep 06 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - great speed-up of file-read-in by using Gambas' internal read-/write-buffer
  - new file-seek and helper methods
  - fixed wrong usage of a static variable in ID3v2-frame
  - added missing string-termination data for different encodings used by ID3v2-Tag
  - added status-code to Tag-readers

* Tue Sep 05 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - better implementation of file-seek for a pattern (experimental)

* Mon Sep 04 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - eased usage of Item-Class (Columns can be addressed directly in CFViewItem)
  - fixed: now the header of always the first MPEG-frame is read and not accidentally skipped
  - fixed: bitrate now is always shown as human readable string and year 0 doesn't exist anymore
    (haven't ever seen any MP3- or ID3-encoder in Jesus' time)
  - added missing ID3v2-frame types
  - generalized frame-creation in first file-read-in (inclusive frame-header)
  - began implementation of ID3v2-frames

* Thu Aug 31 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - basic functionality for ID3v2-Tags added: Header and Extended Header parsing
  - fixed silly bug of wrong sorting of columns in file-display caused by non-documented behaviour when
    catching the Compare-Event
  - many other fixes in CFView (see svn log for complete overview)

* Wed Aug 30 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - enhanced file-display class by property changed items
  - some bug-fixing in file-display class (CFView):
    - fixed possible null-item during enumeration
    - fixed missing displaying of descriptions caused by accidental deletion of all rows to show
  - fixed bug: comparison of non-equal types always returns false
  - further migration from Main class to CFView
  - removed many unused functions from Main class
  - fixed wrong behaviour of ID3v1-Edit dialog  

* Mon Aug 21 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - the code was not working as expected so I had to rewrite large parts of the new file-display class
    (not finished yet)

* Sun Aug 20 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - added recursion to merge-function (only in onDifferDelete-part up to now, more is not yet used anyways)
  - migrated to new file-display class (nearly complete)
  - added optional file-info-tips

* Wed Aug 8 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - extended merge-function by more return values if values differ (min/max/average)

* Tue Aug 8 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - ID3v1-Tag charset now is correctly converted from and to ISO-8859-1
  - some updates for GUI, displaying progress while reading files
  - added possibility to cancel reading of files
  - new method updating GUI
  - fixed bug in pattern-replacement function (%A, %f, etc.)
  - updated project-version number to 0.1
  - added patterns:
    - %K : Tracknumber
    - %s : Sample-Rate
    - %b : Bitrate
    - %d : Directory file resides in
  - added dialog to deal with copying / replacements of Tags in different versions (not functional yet)
  - added settings-dialog: columns to display (changeable order)
  - fixed bug in generic merge-function which caused genre to be "Blues" if differed and had possible other
    side effects due to setting different values to either 0, "" or NULL, which is not always right
  - enhanced ID3v1-Parser to support MPEG 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 (incompletely: sample- and bitrate is somehow
    wrong or my files here are crap)
  - fixed possible wrong handling of parameter in FMain.FeditEntry()
  - (internal) renaming of files added (no changes to file itself up to now, more testing needed, I don't
    want to destroy my music-collection ;) )

* Mon Aug 7 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - added extra checkboxes to editv1-dialog, if changes should be applied
  - added function to convert the following strings to their correspondant information from file:
    - %A : Artist
    - %B : Album
    - %T : Track
    - %f : Filename without path
    - %Y : Year
  - changed items are marked in File-View now via Picture
  - removed workaround for #11-bug since Benoit fixed it => generic merging of classes works now

* Sun Aug 6 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - added function for generic merging
  - tried workaround in merging function for #11-error bug in MHelp.merge
  - added bitrate (if constant) to File-listing and some general file-information in extra dialog
  - the first MPEG-frame-header is read and parsed correctly (except the sample rate at MPEG 2.5-files,
    why ever)

* Sat Aug 5 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - initial version 0.1
  - added working ID3v1-Edit-Dialog (saving not yet supported)
  - added function to merge v1-Tags
  - added working File-View (listing of files including Tags, also recursively)
  - added abstract Tag-Class (optional: writing both tags / reading merged)
  - added working File-Class
  - added fragmentary ID3v2-Class
  - added working ID3v1-Class including merge-function for several tags
