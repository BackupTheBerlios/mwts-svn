* Wed Aug 8 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - extended merge-function by more return values if values differ (min/max/average)

* Tue Aug 8 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - ID3v1-Tag charset now is correctly converted from and to ISO-8859-1
  - some updates for GUI, displaying progress while reading files
  - added possibility to cancel reading of files
  - new method updating GUI
  - fixed bug in pattern-replacement function (%A, %f, etc.)
  - updated project-version number to 0.1
  - added patterns:
    - %K : Tracknumber
    - %s : Sample-Rate
    - %b : Bitrate
    - %d : Directory file resides in
  - added dialog to deal with copying / replacements of Tags in different versions (not functional yet)
  - added settings-dialog: columns to display (changeable order)
  - fixed bug in generic merge-function which caused genre to be "Blues" if differed and had possible other
    side effects due to setting different values to either 0, "" or NULL, which is not always right
  - enhanced ID3v1-Parser to support MPEG 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 (incompletely: sample- and bitrate is somehow
    wrong or my files here are crap)
  - fixed possible wrong handling of parameter in FMain.FeditEntry()
  - (internal) renaming of files added (no changes to file itself up to now, more testing needed, I don't
    want to destroy my music-collection ;) )

* Mon Aug 7 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - added extra checkboxes to editv1-dialog, if changes should be applied
  - added function to convert the following strings to their correspondant information from file:

    - %B : Album
    - %T : Track
    - %f : Filename without path
    - %Y : Year
  - changed items are marked in File-View now via Picture
  - removed workaround for #11-bug since Benoit fixed it => generic merging of classes works now

* Sun Aug 6 2006 Franz Brauße <mike-nought@gmx.de>
  - added function for generic merging
  - tried workaround in merging function for #11-error bug in MHelp.merge
  - added bitrate (if constant) to File-listing and some general file-information in extra dialog

    why ever)
