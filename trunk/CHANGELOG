  - added settings-dialog: columns to display (changeable order)

  - enhanced ID3v1-Parser to support MPEG 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 (incompletely: sample- and bitrate is somehow
    wrong or my files here are crap)
  - fixed possible wrong handling of parameter in FMain.FeditEntry()
  - (internal) renaming of files added (no changes to file itself up to now, more testing needed, I don't
